# What is C++

* General-purpose programming language
* Object-oriented
* Functional
* Procedural
* Generic

The programming language was developed in the 1970's by Bjarne Stroustrup
and was known as 'C with classes'. It is well recognized and used because
it also supports Functional, Procedural, and Generic programming paradigms.

C++ is based on the C language, building on top of the language while retaining
much of the syntax, efficiency, and utilities. The language can be used to write
programs at all levels, including **Applications**, **OS**, and **Firmware**.
Most of the popular languages used in development today are written in either
C or C++.

Some major components of C++ are:
  - Preprocessor
  - C language syntax
  - Classes and objects
  - C++ templates
  - STL (Standard Template Library)

All of these components will be covered in much further detail throughout
the exercises.
