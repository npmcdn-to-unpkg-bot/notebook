# Introduction to basic syntax

```c++
#include <cstdio>
using namespace std;

int main( int argc, char ** argv ) // The main function
{
  puts("Hello, World!"); // A statement
  int x = 12; // A variable
  return 0;
}
```

*Statement*: A unit of code terminated by a semicolon, and are utilized to do a variety of things including invoking functions, declare/initialize variables, or operate on expressions.

*Function*: A larger unit of code that may contain many statements or expressions. A function is designed to be reused or called by another function.

*main()*: Main is the core entrypoint for any c++ program. It is called by the OS when the program first launches.

*Variable*: Variables are used to store the result of a given number of expressions. In C++ variables must be declared before they are used.
